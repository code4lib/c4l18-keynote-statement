# Code4Lib Community Statement in Support of Chris Bourg

Last month, MIT Library Director Chris Bourg was chosen by community vote
to deliver a keynote lecture at the [Code4Lib](http://2018.code4lib.org/)
(library software developers’) conference, in which she cited
[research](https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/TechLeavers2017.pdf)
examining why people from marginalized groups voluntarily leave jobs in the
tech world. Since then, she has been subjected to widespread and coordinated
harassment across several platforms, including homophobic and sexist personal
attacks, as well as commentary that discounts her expertise, ignores the nuances
of her argument, and misrepresents her position. The 2018 organizing committee
and Code4Lib conference planners would like to express our wholehearted support
of Dr. Bourg and our gratitude to her for her important message. We join with
other members of the Code4Lib community in condemning this distressing and
unprofessional behavior.
